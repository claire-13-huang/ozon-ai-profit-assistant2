   - Expected: result explanation appears, total cost composition is explained, profit margin meaning is explained, and one highest cost pressure item is shown.

2. High purchase cost
   - Input: use normal valid input, then set purchase cost much higher than other costs, such as 80.
   - Expected: explanation identifies purchase cost as the main pressure item.

3. High logistics fee
   - Input: use valid input with low purchase cost and choose product weight/dimensions that create high logistics cost.
   - Expected: explanation identifies logistics fee as the main pressure item when logistics is the largest known cost.
