# Manual Test Cases

## Cost And Result Explanation

1. Normal valid input with balanced costs
   - Input: sale price 100, exchange rate 12.5, weight 500g, dimensions 10/10/10, purchase cost 30, commission 10%, advertising 5%.
   - Expected: result explanation appears, total cost composition is explained, profit margin meaning is explained, and one highest cost pressure item is shown.

2. High purchase cost
   - Input: use normal valid input, then set purchase cost much higher than other costs, such as 80.
   - Expected: explanation identifies purchase cost as the main pressure item.

3. High logistics fee
   - Input: use valid input with low purchase cost and choose product weight/dimensions that create high logistics cost.
   - Expected: explanation identifies logistics fee as the main pressure item when logistics is the largest known cost.

4. High advertising rate
   - Input: use normal valid input, then set advertising rate high, such as 40%.
   - Expected: explanation identifies advertising fee as a pressure item and warns that ad spend can reduce real profit.

5. Low profit margin
   - Input: adjust purchase cost or advertising rate until profit margin is below 10% but not negative.
   - Expected: explanation says low profit margin may be affected by return, ad fluctuation, or exchange-rate changes.

6. Negative profit
   - Input: set purchase cost higher than selling price, such as sale price 100 and purchase cost 120.
   - Expected: explanation says current profit is negative and suggests reviewing cost or selling price before testing.

7. Invalid input should not show misleading explanation
   - Input: clear selling price, set exchange rate to 0, or set negative purchase cost.
   - Expected: validation message appears and explanation says to fix input first.

8. CSV export still works after valid calculation
   - Input: return to a valid normal input.
   - Expected: calculation results update normally and CSV export still downloads.

## Decision-Focused UI

1. Negative profit should show strong risk state and cautious next action
   - Input: sale price 100, exchange rate 12.5, weight 500g, dimensions 10/10/10, purchase cost 120.
   - Expected: profit decision shows risk and next action warns not to scale before checking the main cost pressure.

2. Low profit margin should show warning state and small-test suggestion
   - Input: sale price 100, exchange rate 12.5, weight 500g, dimensions 10/10/10, purchase cost 75.
   - Expected: next action recommends small testing and checking the pressure item.

3. High purchase cost should recommend checking purchase cost
   - Input: use valid input and make purchase cost the largest cost item.
   - Expected: next action recommends checking purchase cost.

4. High logistics cost should recommend checking logistics/channel/product size
   - Input: use valid input and increase weight or dimensions so logistics fee is the largest cost item.
   - Expected: next action recommends checking product size, weight, or channel fit.

5. High advertising rate should recommend checking ad budget or test scale
   - Input: use valid input and set advertising rate high enough to become the largest cost item.
   - Expected: next action recommends controlling budget and small-scale testing.

6. Healthy profit should show neutral-positive next action
   - Input: adjust costs so profit margin is between 10% and 25%.
   - Expected: next action suggests continuing to review return rate, ads, and exchange-rate changes.

7. Good profit should show positive but still cautious next action
   - Input: use valid input with profit margin above 25%.
   - Expected: next action says profit looks good but still needs return and ad validation.

8. Invalid input should not show confident next action
   - Input: clear selling price or set exchange rate to 0.
   - Expected: next action asks the user to fix input first.

9. CSV export still works after valid calculation
   - Input: return to valid input and click export.
   - Expected: CSV still downloads.

## LocalStorage Save/Load

1. Fill normal valid values, refresh page, values restore
   - Input: sale price 100, exchange rate 12.5, weight 500g, dimensions 10/10/10, purchase cost 30, commission 10%, advertising 5%.
   - Expected: after refresh, the same input values are restored and calculation runs again.

2. Change platform/supplier/service, refresh page, selections restore
   - Input: switch platform and choose a supplier/service combination.
   - Expected: after refresh, platform, supplier, and service are restored when those options still exist.

3. Fill invalid value, refresh page, validation still catches it
   - Input: set purchase cost to -5 or exchange rate to 0, then refresh.
   - Expected: invalid value is restored and validation shows the same blocking error.

4. Clear/reset values if reset behavior exists
   - Input: no reset/clear button currently exists.
   - Expected: no reset behavior is tested in this milestone; clearing can be added later with a dedicated button.

5. Recalculate after restore
   - Input: refresh after valid saved values.
   - Expected: logistics, profit decision, cost explanation, and result cards update after restore.

6. CSV export still works after restore
   - Input: refresh after valid saved values, then click CSV export.
   - Expected: CSV still downloads with the restored calculation state.

7. localStorage unavailable should not break the app if detectable
   - Input: test in private/restricted storage mode if available.
   - Expected: app still calculates normally; values may simply not persist.

## Healthy Profit Baseline Preset

1. Apply Healthy Profit Baseline preset
   - Input: click the preset apply button for `Healthy Profit Baseline`.
   - Expected: platform switches to Ozon, supplier is CEL, service is automatic, and the preset status confirms the template was applied.

2. Confirm input fields are filled

   - Expected: sale price 100, exchange rate 12.5, weight 500g, dimensions 10/10/10, purchase cost 50, commission 10%, advertising 5%, tax 0%, withdrawal 0%, return 0%, label fee 1, and other cost 2 are filled.

3. Confirm profit calculation updates
   - Input: apply the preset and review the result area.
   - Expected: total cost, profit, profit margin, logistics match, diagnosis, next action, and cost explanation update through the normal calculation flow.

4. Refresh page and confirm localStorage restores preset values
   - Input: apply the preset, refresh the page.
   - Expected: platform, supplier, service, and preset-filled inputs restore; calculation runs again after restore.

5. Modify one preset-filled value and confirm calculation updates
   - Input: after applying the preset, change purchase cost or advertising rate.
   - Expected: total cost, profit, profit margin, diagnosis, next action, and cost explanation update automatically.

6. Enter invalid value after applying preset and confirm validation still works
   - Input: after applying the preset, set exchange rate to 0 or purchase cost to -1.

7. CSV export after applying preset
   - Input: apply the preset, confirm valid calculation, then click CSV export.
   - Expected: CSV still downloads with the current calculated result.
